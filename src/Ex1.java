//Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
//For example, a child inherits the traits of his or hers parents.
//With inheritance,
// we can reuse the fields and methods of the already existing class.
// therefore, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of object oriented programming.
